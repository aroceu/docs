<h1 id="etymology">Etymology</h1>

<p>"<big>aroceu</big>" is not based in anything specific nor is it drawn from any language. It is a made-up word comprised of letters in a sequence that is significant to me. You may pronounce it however you want; I pronounce it as "ə-rō-su."</p>

<p>My internet name is <b>Arrow Sparrow</b>, named after the Wudai weapon held by Kimiko from Xiaolin Showdown. Xiaolin Showdown is one of my favorite TV shows (not to mention cartoons) and I love Kimiko and birds and long range attacks, much like the in-universe weapon. <i>Arrow</i> is also, incidentally, a homophone of the name I used to go by on the internet.</big>

<h1 id="domains">Domain Overview</h1>

<p>The design for each site represents a level of familiarity, fun, or personal attachment I feel to the page content, while being appropriate for the webpage's intent. I used to redesign my websites all the time when I was younger; but over time as I've learned and developed better skills, my code has become more complex and I'm not as fond of the idea anymore. I prefer seeing how long I can be happy with a design these days.</p>

<p>If you'd like to learn more about each website, click on their link in the list below to take you to further documentation. Check out my <a href="etc#design">design philosphies</a> as well if you're interested in the intention of my design approach.</p>

<p><u><b><a href="#dotcom">aroceu.com</a></b></u> is my primary domain because anything and everything under this URL feels like a reflection of the things I love, or me, which are intimately connected anyway. I'm a passionate creative and enthusiast (and minimalist) at heart, and everything about and under this domain represent that.</p>

<p><u><b><a href="#kingdra">kingdra.net</a></b></u> is for website-related miscellany that are not intrinsic to my identity and instead may be more resourceful or interesting to others. This includes archived projects at various levels of completion but may not receive regular updates.</p> 

<p>The front page is my indie website portal - essentially, centered on my participation on the independent web rather than me. This includes updates and site maps (as I have multiple websites), cliques (as they're just fun for me to join), a FAQ (because why not), other indie sites I think are cool, and a guestbook.</p>

<p><u><b><a href="#icirrus">icirr.us</a></b></u> is where everything related to my love of Pok&eacute;mon goes. I've loved Pok&eacute;mon longer than I've been aroceu, so this has its own domain.</p>

<p><u><b>aroceu.cloud</b></u> is a vanity URL for my Bluesky account because I love microblogging and aroceu.com is too corporate-looking as a username for me. "cloud" is much cuter and fits in with the conceit of a ~blue sky~. Additionally, with the more technological idea of a cloud, I also use this domain for my email. Any emails sent to my other domains redirect here.</p>

<h1 id="dotcom">aroceu.com</h1>
<p>My main website; and where you go if you want to contact me. It&#39;s set up this way - domain and all - because it&#39;s the URL I give out the most. It has all the information I find necessary about me as well as ways to contact me and links to the creative projects that are close or relevant to me personally. This includes: my fic, library, gifts, and prompt generators.</p>

<h2>fic (<a href="https://aroceu.com/fic/documentation">full documentation</a>)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Where all* of my fic is archived.</li>
<li>Runs on WordPress, uses a good amount of plugins and a custom theme. </li>
<li>Will have commissioned banners  one day, but for now enjoy the star pattern I made in like 5 minutes in Photoshop.</li>
<li>Each fic has its own page and can be sorted, filtered, and searched for in a variety of ways. WIPs have a custom template, fic pages emulate AO3&#39;s readerstyle with personal flourishes, and allow you to bookmark the fic on AO3 (if you&#39;d like), a mirrored link at AO3 (if it exists), and a social media promotional post (if it exists).</li>
<li>Additional features: A mobile menu/filter option, night mode</li>
</ul>
<p>Includes: an about section (writer version), related works, my transformative works policy. </p>
<p><small>* Not really, but for the purposes of this documentation the sentiment is there.</small></p>
<h2>library</h2>
<ul>
<li>Where I keep track of the various forms of entertainment that I enjoy</li>
<li>Raw coded</li>
<li>Intentionally reminiscent of cutesy lightweight pixel sites with a modern spin</li>
<li>Features: collapsible menus, a collapsible gallery, bad color contrast, and an over-abundance of patterned backgrounds</li>
<li>Inspired by <a href="https://cloverso.me">Clover's</a> <a href="https://catso.neocities.org/library/">library</a>
</ul>
<p>Includes: main library, &quot;the list&quot; (to do), favorites, log (current)</p>
<h2>gifts (<a href="https://aroceu.com/gifts/documentation">full documentation</a>)</h2>
<ul>
    <li>A repository of the creative and largely fannish works people have made for me over the years. This includes commissions I've paid for (art), gifts from my friends and exchange events (fic and art), and my over-investment in Splatoon commissions specifically.</li>
    <li>Raw coded</li>
    <li>A cutesy lightweight pixel site, but for real this time</li>
    <li>Uses Lightbox for image galleries</li>
    <li>Features: fixed sidebar, lots of decorative pixels, fun and colorful lists</li>
</ul>
<h2>prompt generators</h2>
<ul>
<li>A hub of prompt generators coded from scratch. Free to use by the public for any creative purpose, though the original idea was for fanfiction. </li>
<li>Raw coded</li>
<li>More lightweight than you&#39;d think; written primarily in PHP.</li>
<li>Each prompt generator has a unique and fun design to represent the fandom/subject it&#39;s generating for.</li>
</ul>
<p>Notable generators: Haikyuu, MDZS, Sexy Times with Wangxian, any of the lyric generators, to Lovers (a personal favorite)</p>
<h2>smaller sections</h2>
<h4>projects</h4>
<p>My non-fanfiction fanworks. Includes videos, fanmixes, meta/essays, and others.</p>
<h4>music</h4>
<p>A text archive of music I've listened to, in tandem with my respective playlists for each year. I usually nest this one under library for similar archival reasons, even though it is not a subsection of my library.</p>
<h4>tsn</h4>
<p>A list of quick links of my Social Network brainrot, on the internet.</p>
<h4>manifesto</h4>
<p>An essay on the meaning and importance of independent website curation to me.</p>
<h2>archived</h2>
<p>These are older sections that are no longer online.</p>
<h4>stuff</h4>
<p>I decided to remove <b>stuff</b>, which used to host sozai (graphics/web content), in October of 2024 due to redundancy as well as my general preference for sharing my graphics (which I make more of these days than website codes) on my <a href="https://ceu.dreamwidth.org">Dreamwidth</a> instead. When it was up, I used <a href="https://picocms.org">Pico</a> as its content management system.</p>
<h4>love</h4>
<p>My former list of fandoms, removed sometime between 2021 to 2023, I don&#39;t remember. Mostly because I got so tired of the design that I felt happier with it offline.</p>

<h1 id="kingdra">kingdra.net</h1>

<p>kingdra.net hosts my mini projects, projects that are more resourceful than they are about me, and (archived) one-time projects.</p>
<h2>index</h2>
<p>A network of things pertaining to myself as a website-builder. The top navigation contains links to my main projects, while the bottom navigation contains links to internal pages, including: universal site updates, cliques, map, faq, and a guestbook.</p>
<p>The design features heavy image usage, primarily in the form of old school online stamps, buttons, and blinkies. The internal pages change via a central iframe. This page also contains my latest status from status.cafe.</p>
<h2>links </h2>
<p>An archive of links, like bookmarks, for me to keep track of links I&#39;ve saved over the years (and presently and in the future). Also part of my passion project to the old school internet, which is having a &quot;links&quot; page full of fun and interesting resources, though mine is a bit more expansive than that. Organized by topical category.</p>
<p>Each page is contained in an iFrame, so separate pages of links can be opened in a simpler page for independent viewing if needed. The mobile version is only text on a white background, and navigates between the internal pages as separate pages without the iFrame.</p>
<h2>archived projects</h2>
<h4>this is our thing (em)</h4>
<p>A webshrine dedicated to the relationship between characters from <em>the Social Network</em>, Mark/Eduardo. I had a lot of ambitions to make this shrine, but I only got through their character bios before my interest in it weaned down. But it was my first attempt at making one, however unsuccessful.</p>
<p>The layout has custom edited banners with circular screenshots from the movie on every page. It is designed largely in black and white to reflect a website that is &quot;plain and simple. No Disneyland, no &#39;Live Nude Girls&#39;...&quot;</p>
<h4>know where to run (kwtr)</h4>
<p>An interactive fanfiction my and my Sports Anime Shipping Olympics (SASO) team made in 2015. I coded the CSS and HTML, my teammate Icie coded the Javascript. </p>
<p>The website allows you to pick any of 6 different vignettes in any order, with a 7th in the center that is unclickable until all 6 have been clicked. The 7th is the static end, and upon closing out, the visitor gets sent back to the splash page.</p>

<h1 id="icirrus">icirr.us</h1>
<p>Also known as &quot;Masterball,&quot; this is my Pok&eacute;mon website where I showcase everything relevant to my love for Pok&eacute;mon. This site is separated into two major parts, &quot;Trainer&quot; (parties of my main game playthroughs), and &quot;Gym&quot; (Pok&eacute;mon Go and website-related stuff). More will be added for Pok&eacute;Rogue/fangames and TCG.</p>
<p>The front page is designed like a masterball in a clean pastel style, which translates across the trainer pages. The gym pages, meanwhile, are a little more old school.</p>
<h2>trainer</h2>
<p>An archive of the mainline games I&#39;ve played, and my teams on the games. On the landing page, there is a link to an &quot;About&quot; section along with an icon of the type of NPC I would be in game, a Ranger (female, ORAS). A small pop-up with my OT name, top 6 favorite Pok&eacute;mon in a team, my trainer ID in my game of choice, and my personality/nature (mild, likes to fight), as well as a brief history, are linked internally on this page.</p>
<p>Each game page is color themed by its game, e.g. Ruby is red, HeartGold is a light yellow, and so on. As the platform for each changes, some stylistic elements of the page may be added to reflect this: games on the 3DS have a &quot;3D&quot; effect, while Switch games have borders on both sides. My trainer selection of choice (usually female) is on the page, along with the region, year I played it, and a small blurb about my relationship with the game. At the bottom is a footer navigating between all the games in the &quot;trainer&quot; section.</p>
<p>Each party Pok&eacute;mon has listed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Its species (Pok&eacute;mon)</li>
<li>Gender</li>
<li>Pok&eacute;ball caught in </li>
<li>Name</li>
<li>Current level</li>
<li>Nature/characteristic</li>
<li>Ribbons (if applicable)</li>
<li>IVs</li>
<li>Ability</li>
<li>Moveset (Javascript dropdown box)</li>
</ul>
<p>Pages in this section in addition to the games include: </p>
<ul>
<li>Favorites (of everything I could possibly have a favorite of)</li>
<li>Shiny gallery</li>
<li>Misc - other teams I have used for other playthroughs (which were not my first, or because the Pok&eacute;mon meant something to me in some way) or goals</li>
</ul>
<h2>gym</h2>
<p>The landing page is designed to be reminiscent of a gym from the first gen I ever owned/played, Pok&eacute;mon Ruby/gen 3. The navigation is reminiscent of the standard battle menu.</p>
<h4>fight</h4>
<p>The &quot;about the site&quot; section. Contains animated pixels of 5 Pok&eacute;mon who are internal links (via Javascript dropdown); they are also all steel types. </p>
<ul>
<li>Bisharp (shiny): Link to Github project and Dreamwidth updates comm</li>
<li>Aegislash (shiny): 3DS friend code, Switch friend code, email</li>
<li>Aggron (shiny): About my present relationship with the franchise</li>
<li>Excadrill (shiny): About the website/name</li>
<li>Tinkaton (not a gif ☹ ): Linkback buttons</li>
</ul>
<h4>bag</h4>
<p>A fancy sitemap. It initially opens like a &quot;bag&quot; (Javascript), with options for internal pages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bicycle (just for flavor text)</li>
<li>Town Map (the actual map)</li>
<li>Vs. Seeker (takes you to trainer)</li>
<li>Masterball x1 (takes you back to index)</li>
<li>Close Bag (takes you back to gym)</li>
</ul>
<h4>Pok&eacute;mon Go</h4>
<p>My Pok&eacute;mon Go archive. Designed reminiscent of the game; my team (Valor) is embedded into the theme as well. Includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Username / level</li>
<li>My current trainer avatar</li>
<li>Trainer code</li>
<li>Start date</li>
<li>Pok&eacute;dex Progress</li>
<li>A large pixel list of Pok&eacute;mon I have caught/not caught, indicated by transparency</li>
</ul>
<h4>run</h4>
<p>Exit links out.</p></ul>
