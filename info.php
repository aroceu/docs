<h1 id="etymology">Etymology</h1>

<p>"<big>aroceu</big>" is not based in anything specific nor is it drawn from any language. It is a made-up word comprised of letters in a sequence that is significant to me. You may pronounce it however you want; I pronounce it as "ə-rō-su."</p>

<p>My internet name is <b>Arrow Sparrow</b>, named after the Wudai weapon held by Kimiko from Xiaolin Showdown. Xiaolin Showdown is one of my favorite TV shows (not to mention cartoons) and I love Kimiko and birds and long range attacks, much like the in-universe weapon. "Arrow" is also, incidentally, a homophone of the name I used to go by on the internet.</big>

<h1 id="domains">Domain Overview</h1>

<p>I currently maintain six domains; they are each unique in scale and depth based on the intention of the project. How they are organized and what I choose to do with them is a peek into my messy little psyche.</p>

<p>My domains intentionally consist of 4 of the 5 most common TLDs. I do not like doubling up on them, so they tend to be unique amongst my projects.</p>

<p class="center"><a href="#dotcom">aroceu.com</a> &bull; <a href="#kingdra">kingdra.net</a> &bull; <a href="#icirrus">icirr.us</a> &bull; <a href="#fandomring">fandomr.ing</a> &bull; <a href="#badbuddy">badbuddy.wiki</a> &bull; <a href="#threeapples">three-apples.org</a></p>

<div id="domains">

<h2 id="dotcom">aroceu.com</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Established:</strong> 14 December 2014</p>
<p><strong>Version:</strong> 6.2 <small>(<em>"oh I leave quite an impression"</em>)</small></p>
<p><strong>Main Colors:</strong> Light blue, grey, pink</p>
<p><strong>Main Fonts:</strong> Rochester/Cookie, Inconsolata, Open Sans</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>aroceu.com</strong> is my primary and personal domain. I often think of it as "me in website form." It consists of a variety of different projects, each with their own unique design and intent in existing.</p>

<p>I chose <code>.com</code> as the TLD for this site because it's the most common one, and therefore easy to intuit instead of needing to remember. Despite my aesthetic tendencies, I would still like to be accessible, to some degree. However, I'm not super fond of <code>.com</code> as a Bluesky handle, which is why my Bluesky (and email) domain is <strong>aroceu.cloud</strong> instead.</p>

<p>The landing page is a simple, branching root connecting them all with the appearance of minimalism: the first impression you'll often get of me. It's set up this way - domain and all - because it's the URL I give out the most, so the social links make it easy to contact me elsewhere. Other information and links on this page are things that I think are necessary for that first impression, and perhaps to pique a bit of curiosity.</p>

<p>Everything housed here is its own individual subproject in some way, because I think of my identity as an amalgamation of things I love as well as things that make me uniquely me. I'm categorical by nature, and love the thrill of entering a new webpage and discovering a new aesthetic or design. At my core I feel prismatic, so the way I lay out the projects under this domain helps to reflect that.</p>

<p>For the sake of organization, I've grouped the projects under this domain into four primary categories. Each is relevant to who I am under this alias:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Personal - Me, Log, Gifts</li>
	<li>Creative - Fic, Projects, Prompt Generators</li>
	<li>Fannish - Library, Movies, Music, subsections dedicated to specific media I like</li>
	<li>Internet - Docs, Atlas, Manifesto</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="kingdra">kingdra.net</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Established:</strong> 19 April 2015</p>
<p><strong>Version:</strong> 1.0 <small>(<em>"the world's most impractical site"</em>)</small></p>
<p><strong>Main Colors:</strong> Ceruleans, creams, yellows</p>
<p><strong>Main Fonts:</strong> Inconsolata</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I refer to this as my portal, or network of websites. I generally think of the site as "what the inside of my brain looks like."</p> 

<p>As my love for making websites stems beyond projects reflecting who I am at my core,
    <strong>kingdra.net</strong> serves to bridge the gap between me and other websites, or me and other people.
    Similarly, it hosts projects that do not (or no longer) feel as personal to me as the projects on
    <code>aroceu.com</code>, but I still find them valuable or interesting to share.
</p>

<p>
This was a placeholder domain for the longest time, mostly because I wanted to like Kingdra more as a Pokémon and in 2015, I only liked 
the idea of owning this specific domain. I didn't launch a real design for the main page until 26 October 2024, during the third 
significant wave of a webdesign hyperfixation in my adult life, when I realized that I wanted to expand my passion for making 
websites beyond projects that are intimately tied to who I am. This was my biggest mental block when it came to my websites 
in the past - while I like making things intrinsically tied to who I am, those aren't the <em>only</em> projects I like to make. 
It's psychically uncomfortable for me to have projects that feel less "personal" under an umbrella domain that is ultimately 
personal. When I do, I feel like I'm lying to myself as well as other people.
</p>

<p>
So kingdra.net exists for those specific neuroses. It sat around for about nine years with random subprojects not fit 
for my personal site, but through the aforementioned hyperfixation, expanding it became necessary the more I thought 
about how I wanted to share and participate in the independent web. Plus, I grew to like Kingdra as a Pokémon a lot more 
than I did in 2015. I kind of tricked myself into liking it more after owning this domain for so long, but I think it
was meant to be simply because I <em>wanted</em> to like it.
</p>

<p>
At one point this site had its own documentation. As of late July 2025, I've scrapped it and rehashed the important details here:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>The main desktop page is set up with three columns and top navigation because on my first website, the layout I'd made for it and liked the most was structured in the same way.</li>
	<li>Similarly, the main desktop uses iframes identically to that layout on my first website. I also find it practical for this site, in curating an aimless scavenger hunt with a bunch of smaller pages to find and view in a fixed frame like a portal.</li>
	<li>The background came from my retired <code>stuff</code> section, which I liked a lot and wanted to find another reason to use it. Luckily, I launched the index of kingdra.net shortly after retiring <code>stuff</code>.</li>
	<li>All the stamps and linkback buttons existed briefly in my personal site's library before I moved them here.</li>
	<li>I use the same notebook background here as I do on my personal log and other sections, because I've always loved notebooks. When I was younger, I actually made a handful of themes based on my love for notebooks, so every thing I reuse this background is a testament to that.</li>
	<li>While I am not a furry, the way I feel about my splatsona is similar, in terms of having an externalized persona. I say this because my inspiration for having my splatsona in the corner was from visiting a lot of furry websites where people's fursonas had a similar function.</li>
	<li>My favorite thing about the indie web has always been visiting other people's websites; I used to ask to affiliate a <em>lot</em> when I was younger, mostly as a bookmark to visit people's sites again. In that time, the internet has expanded and I've grown more reclusive. But I still love visiting people's websites with the same fervor, which is why I have such an extensive button wall.</li>
	<li>Once I hit a hundred buttons on the page, though, I realized it might be a little impractical for really anyone else to visit. So now I have a random rotation of five on each page load, because I want people to be as interested in visiting those personal sites as I am.</li>
	<li>This website is primarily for me to maintain and keep track of things related to my websites and beyond, such as things I make irregularly, my favorite albums, and old flash games I like being nostalgic for, in addition to more housekeeping things like network updates and future plans. This is part of why the desktop design is so impractical - the only audience it serves to appeal to is me.</li>
	</ul>

<p>My main projects under <code>aroceu.com</code> are linked at the top of the desktop page because it is ultimately still my main website. Additional domain projects can be found on the side, and the iframe navigation at the bottom links to the most distinct and necessary pages. The mobile/text-only alternative lists all internal or network pages linked from the desktop.</p>

<h2 id="icirrus">icirr.us, or Masterball</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Established:</strong> 6 February 2017</p>
<p><strong>Version:</strong> 2.1</p>
<p><strong>Main Colors:</strong> Purple, pink, white, Pokémon</p>
<p><strong>Main Fonts:</strong> Futura/Century Gothic, Lato, Inconsolata</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My Pokémon website, which was a subdomain for about a year until I moved it to a domain completely unrelated to its site title. Regardless, both master balls and Icirrus City have personal relevance to me in my relationship with Pokémon.</p> 

<p>My love for Pokémon has its own domain because it's the thing I've loved consistently the most and for the longest, ever since I was five-years old. This site is to represent the omnipresence of Pokémon in my life, and to be a creative exercise in making different types of webpages. Unlike my other websites, <strong>Masterball</strong> has more of an emphasis on design over function and experimental over substantial.</p>

<p>But it has quite a bit of substance anyway. Check out its more extensive documentation <a href="https://icirr.us/docs">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="fandomring">fandomr.ing</h2>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Established:</strong> 11 December 2024</p>
<p><strong>Version:</strong> 1.1 <small>("<em>pressing flowers & growing stories</em>")</small></p>
<p><strong>Main Colors:</strong> Red, tan, black, yellow</p>
<p><strong>Main Fonts:</strong> EB Garamond, readable cursive (Playwrite on site, as a nominal reference to fanfiction being a type of "play-write")</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The one and probably only webring I will own, born out of my desire in early December 2025 to join a fandom-related webring relevant to my interests, while also wanting to make a webring myself. Concluding to make this webring occurred after a few days of browsing others, but hey, at least I got here eventually.</p>

<p>The <strong>fandom webring</strong> has turned into an easy method for me to discover new personal websites to check without my needing to browse for them, but rather through people applying to join and me going, "ooh! a new website to check out!" with each email and eagerly clicking each new link. I've never been so enthusiastic about vetting before.</p>

<p>I designed this site to be reminiscent of early personal sites to appeal to my internet elders, with modern flourishes to appeal to newer webdesigners as well. The old-school elements are broader with the bookish look, a more aged aesthetic, and simple one column layout. Modern design elements are expressed through stylistic decoration with the washi tape, images in some headings, and wavy underlined links.</p>

<h2 id="badbuddy">badbuddy.wiki</h2>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Established:</strong> March 2024</p>
<p><strong>Version:</strong> 0.2</p>
<p><strong>Main Colors:</strong> Bad Buddy blue, white</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A long-term project documenting everything about my favorite piece of media. Originally on Fandom before I moved to self-host it with MediaWiki. Under construction.</p>

<h2 id="threeapples">three-apples.org</h2>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Established:</strong> 11 May 2025</p>
<p><strong>Version:</strong> 1.0</p>
<p><strong>Main Colors:</strong> Red, white</p>
<p><strong>Main Fonts:</strong> Poppins, Homemade Apple</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A website for projects related to who I am outside of fandom and the internet; that is, offline and in real life. Will have its own documentation eventually. Under construction.</p>

<h1 id="purpose">Existential Purpose</h1>

<p>My websites exist to:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Present me and the things I like/feel strongly about in ways that make sense and/or appeal to me.</li>
	<li>Be a fun and independent space on the internet where no one's financial interests are even remotely relevant.</li>
	<li>Evolve into interesting projects that past, present, and future versions of me will find cool, if not stepping stones in some way.</li>
	<li>Embody my core principles of: uniqueness of the human experience through creativity, patience and growth,  autonomy and self-celebration without corporate or systemic interest, the importance of personal choice and individual curation, authenticity and integrity, intention and interpretation, and being driven by empathetic curiosity.</li>
</ul>

<p>I make websites:</p>

<ul>
	<li>To personalize and custom design an expansive digital space that is uniquely mine.</li>
	<li>To celebrate things I make and things I like; to be unashamed of myself in ways I cannot or do not want to change.</li>
	<li>To not depend on social media as a representation of who I am. Social media has always been about interaction for me, but that's just one way I can talk to people on the internet. There are dozens more, and even more ways I can have fun on the web, without social media.</li>
	<li>To discover who I am, what I like, what I am inclined to, and what I want. In other words: to be me.</li>
	<li>To expand my capabilities with a skill I didn't even really intend to learn with so much depth in the first place.</li>
	<li>With love, much like the way I live.</li>
</ul>
