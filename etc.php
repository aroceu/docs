<h1 id="design">Design Philosophies</h1>

<p>Over the years I've gone by a handful of names and have had quite a few domains. In the same vein, I've had different approaches to coding, webdesigning, and sharing myself online. </p>

<p>Storytelling is my one true love &mdash; and, honestly, the only thing I really take seriously. (I barely even take myself seriously.) I picked up webdesigning for fun and because vanity projects have always been cool to me, but it took a while for me to establish a style pattern that I liked. From making edited banner layouts to simplified pure CSS with 2 colors, as well as my attempts with more elaborate graphic design, for a long time I felt I couldn't settle on an overall aesthetic that I liked <i>and</i> could pull off as well as I wanted to. Though I was interested in drawing when I was younger, as I put more of my energies into polishing up my storytelling abilities, visual art fell by the wayside for me &mdash; it had become something that I would rather be an enthusiastic enjoyer of rather than a creator for.</p>

<p>I'm an organized and logical thinker. I love exploring technicalities and creating within boundaries, and so even though my interest in drawing and graphic design weaned away, my passion for website building continued to grow. Still, design is a huge element of web development, and while webdesign styles aren't necessarily categorical, I've always known that eventually, I'd want to establish a stylistic identity that would make me stand out. That's one of the beauties of independent web design, isn't it? Instead of building websites for monetary profit, I focus more on what represents me and what <i>I</i> like.</p>

<p>But then that meant that I had to figure out who I was, what I liked, and how I could incorporate my neuroses as well.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Graphic & Organizational Design</h2>

<p>Though I tried in my early days to get into graphic design, it's certainly not in my stylistic instinct. I have better instincts (and software) now, but for a long time now it hasn't been a fundamental part of my webdesign process, only as a decorative additive.</p>

<p>I start here when talking about how I build websites, because it's how I started. But my primary approach now centers text content and convenience, neither of which images are really a necessity for. I learned this from my own experiences with myself; a lot of my early designs were very graphic design-dependent, and though I'm sure my skill now would be a vast improvement from then, I also know that mentally, it feels rigid in existence for me. What if I want to change something, or need to add something, or decide I want to move certain things around, or realize that the way something in an image would look better in a different position/font/color ages after I published it? Sure, I can always edit it &mdash; but the point is that I'm an incredibly indecisive person who has little propensity or patience for being satisfied with my own visual art, and also wants things to last for a long time. The way I feel about custom graphics on my own website is often not compatible with that, even if the time to edit an image takes the same amount of time to edit code.</p>

<p>Between all the aspects of web design and development, I would say that CSS is my favorite part. It's a combination of logic and stylization, modular building and front-end flexibility. And when I don't have images as part of a website's design, CSS is what makes those designs unique and stylized anyway, even without more elaborate flourishes. I'm a minimalist at heart, mostly because I get overwhelmed easily. So the dependency on CSS over graphics in most of my websites represents that. And it's a lot more convenient for me to adjust if I change my mind about something.</p>

<p>Overall, I'm drawn to making designs that best present and represent the content they're displaying in some way, with both personal and modern flourishes. Websites are about the content, after all; the design is the architecture. Much like storytelling, I take a lot of care into thinking about the most effective (simplistic & convenient) way of presenting the content, while in the same vein figuring out how to make it unique and distinct &mdash; how the site could represent choices only <i>I</i> would make for its design. I suppose this is redundant since only I can make the things that I make...but my point stands. Even if the decision is as simple as <code>&lt;text in white box on a colored background in the middle of the page&gt;</code> I made the decision for a reason in the first place.</p>

<p>I also now enjoy using graphics made by others a lot more than I used to. When I was younger, I was much more possessive and selective about having only graphics that I made, as part of a personal neurosis for being entirely self-made. But since then I've relaxed, especially when it comes to building webpages that <i>aren't</i> just about the things that I've made. Creativity is not an antonym of transformative, and it brings me a lot of joy to be inspired by others and use the resources available to me to build something that's not only representative of me, but also how I see and interact with the world.</p>

<p>But I won't get too philosophical, because sometimes it's not that deep. Sometimes it's because I like lighter and less saturated shades of blue; because I like anchors as an image motif; because the easiest way to experience content is by having it be easy to experience in the first place. Though my code and personal practicing skill may have a few areas of improvement, what matters most to me is having a website and going, look, that's mine, isn't it neat? And at this point in time, I'd like to think I'm pretty good at that.</p>

<p>Obviously this is not to say anything against other approaches to design: this is simply mine. I love admiring websites that were designed by people who think much differently than me (everyone), because I think "man I wish I could do something like that" and get reminded of the prison maze of my mind. But you ought to see my Animal Crossing: New Horizons island &mdash; it's like a prison maze if it was for cute animals.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fonts</h2>

<p>I've put a lot of thought into font usage all my life, both as a writer and as a designer. Even now, though I've settled into a vibe that feels accessible and convenient and unique (all of which are my primary concerns with anything visually creative on my end), fonts are still something I spend a lot of time thinking deeply about, because much like any other aspect of design, they are fundamental in not only displaying <i>what</i> the content is, but <i>how</i> it gets displayed and read.</p>

<p>I prefer serif (Cambria) when writing stories, but sans-serif when it's my website telling the story, not me. I like to think it's because I take writing more seriously than websiting; sans-serif has always felt more informal and everyday to me, much like my own approach to websites. Yet there's no denying my passion for it even in this regard, so I've really become inclined to monospace fonts as well. Maybe these things are connected. Most of the pages on this personal domain use the same monospace font, so maybe that means something.</p>

<p>Either way, like my preference for designs being long-lasting, I like having dependable fonts as well, rather than needing to scour the many font websites and repositories to find a new one that I like. Most of my website projects are vanity projects anyway, so that checks out. I would say though that my favorite font style is undoubtedly a handwritten cursive, because it emulates the casual cutesy but stylized vibe that I usually go for. And that's how I would describe my actual handwriting too.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Colors</h2>

<p>Establishing an identity of colors in design was as difficult and long as my own indecision when it comes to colors I like. Now I'm confident when I say that my favorite color is a light less-saturated blue.</p>

<p>Still, like with the people in the world (and on the internet), I have a relationship with colors, too. Pink was the very first color I fell in love with, but I've always been personally drawn to lighter, tealer shades of blue &mdash; never really the royal side though. I feel a kinship with the ocean too, and if I had to describe my personality and understanding of myself as a color, it would also be that light shade of grey-blue.</p>

<p>I say this here because all of my websites on my .com are very notably centered around this blue (or variants), if you haven't noticed. Blue feels like it's <i>me</i>; pink feels like the things I love, and I love a lot of things as well. Even the theming around things I love, people I love, and my favorites of things tend to skew more pink, with the exception of my <a href="https://icirr.us/trainer/favs">Pok&eacute;mon favorites</a>, because I wanted to put my favorite NPC (Clair) as the trainer avatar, and the rest of the page complementary to her. </p>

<p>I used to be less personally deliberate with my colors. Actually, my original color palette for a long time and that I often fall back to &mdash; even today &mdash; is black and white. Can't go wrong with the classics, you know. <small>And I used to be obsessed with yin yang symbolism, but that's beside the point.</small> But how I feel about colors when making websites is also like how I feel about the colors in my wardrobe (there's a lot of black) &mdash; I like the idea of being colorful and more experimental and fun, but most times I'll prefer what I'm used to liking and saying are my favorites. </p>

<p>The second time I bought a domain (but the first time it felt personal to me), I had the idea to have all the different subsections of my website centered around a different hue of the rainbow. My blog would be bright pink-red, my contact form would be blue, my fanlistings collective would be green, my portfolio would be yellow, and my web content site would be purple. Though this was certainly a fun idea, it felt like I was dividing myself up into pieces by making them so distinctly different. Now I have even more subsections of my website than I did back then &mdash; but having the blue centering them all feels like they tie back together to represent a whole version of me.</p>

<p>All's this to say: I "am" blue (obviously not really, but I just typed all of this, so...), I love pink, I have a lot of black clothing, and I think other colors are cool and I would use them for designs that are not deeply personal to me. If I had to pick a color I don't like, it would be green because I would always choose it last when selecting colors for any designing purpose, but I don't actively dislike it. I even love grass starters in Pok&eacute;mon.</p>

<p>A handful of my website repositories are public on <a href="https://github.com/aroceu">my Github</a>:</p>

</ul>

<p>You may be interested in the repos for <a href="https://github.com/aroceu/links">my links</a>. Some other projects have private Github repositories instead. Additional material related to my internet presence is aggregated at <a href="https://aroceu.github.io">my Github pages</a>.</p>

<p>I am not a very disciplined developer; everything I learned about web development I initially learned through trial and error with constant browser refreshes, and using whatever's the most convenient to me at the time, so that's the habit I've maintained for the past couple of decades. I recognize that this is not best practice and I am, little by little, trying to improve that.</p>

<p>From beginning to end, here's how I go through the process of creating a website:</p>

<p>First, I come up its concept &mdash; not only what it contains or what its purpose is, but its functionality as a website on the internet, or at least within my existing websites. Several questions I like to consider are:</p>
        <ul><li>Is it going to be a smaller section contained in another, or a large section with its own subpages, or an offshoot section? This is generally determined based on where I would anticipate linking it from and to.</li> 
            <li>Is it static or dynamic? How frequently will I need to update it? How can I maintain updates in the most convenient way possible for me?</li>
            <li>How does the navigation work? Will it have links to all the internal pages, or select links for logistical reasons?</li>
            <li>Will it have any subpages? Would it be easier to maintain if it had subpages?</li></ul>
            
<p>Next is the design. This mostly starts in my head, but almost always I like to draw it out as a wireframe to get a concrete picture and leave specific notes, such as ideas for colors, fonts, interactions, and other elements. From experience, I know that not drawing my design leads me to be extremely indecisive during the coding process. I don't have a preference on my method of drawing &mdash; whether in a notebook or on a piece of cardboard (I have done this before) &mdash; but drawing a website as well as connecting its interactions with other pages has always been a part of my process.</p>

<p>It's important to me that my designs are: simple, intuitively navigable, reflect an aspect of myself or an aspect of the content that I want to display on the webpage, and have a unique or fun element that may make it stand out in one's memory. I'm especially drawn to colors and elemental organization when it comes to design. Some things I keep in mind are:

    <ul><li>Font usage. Fonts represent a tone or character, so it's important to think about the text's intention. For general body text, I favor both sans-serif (due to both its screen preference and more casual connotation) and monospace. I often reserve serif for flavor text.</li>
    
    <li>Padding and containment. Containment is primarily for coding purposes. But I'm also a big fan of negative space.</li>
    <li>Images. What would their purpose be? How much might they distract from the text, or would they make the text more interesting? Would they be necessary, decorative, or excessive? I tend to make more lightweight minimalistic designs, so I don't like depending on graphics.</li>
    <li>Navigation. This includes, but is not limited to: between internal pages, how I would link to the page from any of my existing websites, and the parent-child relationships between internal sections.</li>
    </ul></p>

<p>Then I get to coding, starting with a local file and building from there. As of March 2025 I've incorporated XAMPP into my workflow, which now hosts all of my websites and projects locally, with the exception of WordPress projects in terms of databases, but is still used to test WordPress themes. I create and make all modifications and test locally in XAMPP, typically in raw HTML, CSS, and PHP, with VS Code to help me keep track of every file within a project. (I also anticipate trying out 11ty sometime soon...we'll see!)</p> 

<p>Writing CSS is the most fun part for me, but that's why I start by working on the HTML first - in order to design something, it has to exist in the first place. I code modularly and (sometimes) leave comments in my code, though I've always been a "figure it out" kind of guy, even to myself. In terms of HTML content, I'm a pendant when it comes to word choice, phrasing, and the anatomy of sentences and paragraphs even in an indulgent way. But I'm a lot less concerned in the beginning; copyediting is for the end. I frequently decide to add more HTML elements while writing CSS, so it often tends to be a dual process.</p> 

<p>I like gathering images all at once, instead of figuring them out and adding them bit by bit. This usually constitutes me hand-drawing out a layout first, so I know exactly what kind of graphics I'll need for what, and then dedicating a block of time during the process to hunt them all down before chaining myself to my text editor for the next few hours.</p>

<p>It's difficult for me to work on a site without refreshing the page each time I change or add something to make sure it looks nice. But I suppose this isn't as bad practice as I used to think it was, I just do it locally now. It helps me as well because usually there's always something I'm forgetting in the beginning of creating any project that I can only remember later when I've stared at the webpage long enough to realize what was missing. Through XAMPP I test all the interactive elements to make sure everything works at all times; after I upload the site, I do this again, to account for relative links working. A lot of times while troubleshooting I get better or newer ideas, so it's not unusual for me to make a slightly more significant change even at further points in development.</p>

<p>Toward the end of working on project before making it go live, when I'm satisfied with what I've done for the bulk of its content and design, I start copyediting, rewriting, and rewording some things. I frequently have my phone or computer speak out loud longer blocks of text so I can hear how they sound and make sure that they feel coherent and not too redundant. I am a perfectionist with writing, after all. I also do alt text writing in this stage if I remember to. In my defense, remembering to write alt text is as difficult for me to remember as it was when I was 12.</p>

<p>When I feel that a site is ready to go live, or that I've made all the changes that I want to make in the sitting, I copy the files from XAMPP to my local directory, which I use to organize Git projects. I also do this because the XAMPP directories have folders of unfinished or barely started projects for me to keep track of future plans, while my local directory is for me to keep track of my current ones.</p>

<p>Depending on the project, from the local directory I either upload the changes with FTP via Forklift, or push the changes through Github Desktop and pull them from GitVersion Control in cPanel. I try not to make more changes after this, as using XAMPP has cut that bad practice of mine, I guess. But no promises.</p>

<p>I save the responsive design for last because I don't find it particularly interesting or fun; it's my least favorite part of web development. But I understand its necessity, especially in terms of accessibility, so I configure it at the end. I have a habit of not incorporating responsive designs when I initially make a website go live and instead just configure it later when I feel like it. This is a "<a href="https://i.imgur.com/OgBfYg8.jpeg">I am a dumb bitch with terrible taste / I will never change / I will never improve / That is a promise</a>" moment for me. </p>

<p>I do believe that much like fashion, a website's development is never over. I'm always interested in ways to improve my websites, or make more of them. And I love visiting my own websites - it's fun, and as time passes it gives me a new perspective on how I want to change, or what I might want to add. So, eventually, the workflow stays in the troubleshooting stasis period forever, or starts all over again. </p>

<h1 id="purpose">Personal Site Purpose</h1>

<p>I don't aim for my websites to be perfect, because I don't aim for myself to be perfect. My main motivator in making websites throughout my entire journey has been prioritizing my inner wants and reflecting them as they are true to me. This has resulted in my messy, inconsistent, not always accessible, and often questionably fluent practices whilst making websites. But that's a part of my website and design work ethic, and though I like to improve, the only standards I hold myself to are my own based on what my goal is, which more often than not is to make a fun and creative website, first and foremost.</p>

<p>My favorite websites to visit have always been ones that felt like a scavenger hunt, an experience that required me to explore. So in the same way, I've put a lot of effort into making all of my websites like this. Creatively and from a webdesign angle, I'm most interested in making the type of things I <em>want</em> to see, which also includes the things that I want to experience. It's just as important for me to be in the audience as it is for me to be the word of god; it's a conversation, even if I'm on both sides of it. And yet I think it's an accurate way to depict both myself, and how I see the world. I believe in rewarding curiosity, and that curiosity - the willingness to explore - certainly deserves results. I try to deliver it from my end because I know how much I love it when I'm on the receiving end, and I want to see if other people might be curious in the way that I am too.</p>

<p>Personal authenticity and the agency of choice are the things that drive me the most in my life. While many other things are important to me for many other reasons, at the end of the day, feeling true to who I am and knowing what I want to do - who I want to be - rule my personal-feeling decision making process. It allows me to recognize and accept who I am, flaws and all, and take pride in my uniqueness and inner world, things no one can change because if they could, I wouldn't be myself. I treat and design and care for my websites similarly: if I feel like working on them for something, I will, and if I don't, I won't. If I want to structure a site or a page in a way that makes sense to me even if it may make much less sense to most others, then I will.</p>

<p>I don't aim to be inaccessible, of course. But I also don't aim to allow others' expectations and standards of me to guide my choices or behavior; I'm simply not built like that. I love dialogue and feedback and learning new perspectives because I like learning about the different ways people navigate and communicate and exist in the world; at the same time, I'm on an endless journey to understand myself as well. My conversations and relationships with others do influence me and I'm sure I also influence them, but at the same time I will never hold anyone else's evaluation of me over my own evaluation of myself. And I hope most others are the same way about me - what I think of you matters much less than what <em>you</em> think of you. And what I think of myself and my websites matters much more to me than what others do, too.</p>

<p>I have very strong feelings about nominal, visual, and substance identity. My sites are alive in my head, a dynamic extension of myself in a static interactive visual experience for others. I aim to make the life I breathe into each site and design feel like an active part of the visitor experience, even if incoherent; I aim to do everything with meaning, like fonts and punctuations and minutiae and positioning and sizing and colors and every other element of style. I love the diversity of a collation of designs, and I love it even more when they still insist or try to be part of the uniform identity of this site, <em>me</em>. I love expressing all these different parts of myself. I like thinking about what I want a site or a page to be and how every single element contributes to that in its function, in its identity, in the impression it leaves the visitor. I like creating a cohesive narrative out of a series of small but certainly consequential stylistic and characteristic decisions, because that's also what a narrative is.</p>

<p>I have always felt like an endless depth of tastes and interests and desires and experiences and curiosities; it's one of the reasons why I love exploring the deep sea of the web as well. There's as much of the world out there as there is in me. So I let out all the universes inside of me through the things I make, my websites and designs and pages, even if everything inside of me turns out to be maybe a few hundred pages or so. Still, I'm always trying to relate to everyone that I encounter because I feel the capacity inside of me, that I want to, that I can. In the same way I'm terribly curious about everything, reaching for new perspectives and experiences, wanting to find something new, too, in an ocean of boundless depth and mystery, even in myself. I think my authenticity brings more enrichment even if it may not be accessible at times, because for me being an inconvenience is preferable to being dull and conforming. </p>

<p>I can only make websites that I want to make. That's why I brute-force taught myself this and got into website-making in the first place. It was about the uniqueness of all the small little design elements, the fluidity, the control, the agency. It's a show of my id through my ego, my science through my art, and most importantly, me through something I have always adored and been fascinated by as long as I can remember - technology, and the internet. It's a conversation between me and myself, future and past iterations. </p>

<p>And, of course, it's a conversation between me and you. I believe that the reason we're here for anything is because of our relationships with everyone else in the world, whether in a voyeuristic way or in dialogue. Our relationships with each other enrich our lives, both because learning about others helps us learn about ourselves, and because they just do, even if we're only ships passing in the night. </p>

<h1 id="origins">Origins</h1>

<p><i>This is a technical overview of my journey with website-making. You can also read <a href="https://aroceu.github.io/thoughts/25/webdesign-history">a narrative of my webdesign beginnings</a>, told through the lens of persuading others to make their own personal websites.</i></p>

<p>In 2007 I learned the foundations of what it means to code on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myspace">MySpace</a>, and eventually learned more little by little through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMVU">IMVU</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quizilla">Quizilla</a> in the same year. MySpace and IMVU had similar types of code tweaking in adding nested and floating elements, changing colors of things, making little flourishes but essentially moving elements around on a pre-existing page. Quizilla showed me the fluidity of webdesign &mdash; and what it meant to truly customize a webpage for yourself.</p>

<p>I learn best by doing, so that's what I did. I took other people's code and tried to adjust it to my own liking, but didn't know what I was doing. Like playing a video game for the first time but not reading any of the text. Eventually, though, after much trial and error (and maybe glancing over one or two tutorials when I was getting desperate) I understood the basics of code. Through Quizilla I had also found <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freewebs">Freewebs</a>, which eventually got named to Webs and was the Neocities of its day. Because I had found these sites through the footers of those who were using custom layouts, this was the first type of personal website I got introduced to: those that made layouts for others.</p>

<p>And so through fiddling with my own layout code, that's what I tried to do &mdash; I made layouts for others too. Not necessarily because I expected people to use them, but because once I started making a website design, I couldn't stop. I wanted to keep doing it. It was addicting.</p>

<p>So even with my limited knowledge of code, I started a FreeWebs site in early 2008, my first one. She was a legend, with screenshot graphics of a Disney movie "edited" in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSPaint">Paint</a>. Like the websites I had seen before, I offered <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Sozai">sozai</a> &mdash; web content, graphics and layouts. I also enjoyed looking at others' websites; I began to love going down a clickhole of personally designed websites, that I regularly asked website owners if they wanted to affiliate. After a rejection that remarked upon the quality of my graphics, but was not discouraging, I acknowledged that yes, I needed a better photo editor.</p>

<p>I downloaded <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serif_PhotoPlus">PhotoPlus</a>. It wasn't Photoshop, but it wasn't Paint. Though my initial attempts at graphics were rough, I did eventually get better - to the point of effectiveness, at least, because there are graphic designers I will always envy. But with an eventual confidence in my competent level of graphic design, I decided to move "up" in the webdesign hierarchy in my head &mdash; from a Quizilla site, to a FreeWebs site, and then a subdomain. I wanted a domain eventually, but would definitely need the time to invest and improve first.</p>

<p>The subdomain I procured in early 2009 felt like a true attempt at sophistication. It was also the first time I tried (and succeeded) at writing the code from scratch on my own. I had branched beyond the sozai artists, and stumbled across bloggers &mdash; they offered content as well, but also wrote extensively about their lives. It seemed interesting to me, someone who loves to write and spin narratives out of everything. In this time I also learned PHP, and started learning what code <i>meant</i> not just what it does. A short few months later, for my birthday I asked my mom for a domain as a gift, and I got it. The domain was on a whim and wasn't something I felt personally connected to, but it was a fulfilling purchase nonetheless, and motivated me to continue to do this, and to be better, for <i>me</i>.</p>

<p>My growing attempts to understand how to both design and code well continued on, up until a k-pop hyperfixation overtook my life at the end of 2009.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, I returned to the hobby a couple of years later in 2011. After a much needed break and with a new pair of eyes, my perspective was fresh and cleaner. The addiction was still there, but noticing the improvement in my quality truly made me feel like I could become skilled at this. My budding return to the desire of improving eventually had me returning to the subdomain world about a year later, with my first attempt at a WordPress theme. I wanted to get into blogging; committing to making content wasn't reliable if I wasn't hyperfixated. I should've known that blogging wasn't much different either. But fiddling with the WordPress theme had fascinated me, and I began getting interested in creating those too.</p>

<p>A semi-successful couple of years of blogging later, I purchased a domain again in 2012, but still with the purpose of blogging. That period of my life was particularly difficult and my blog posts reflected that; but despite that, the WordPress themes I made under that domain, both for my website and otherwise, were excellent and I like to show them off even today.</p>

<p>But because the memories and association with my old blog quickly became negative, I eventually ditched it and created a new username in December of 2014: aroceu. I bought this domain at the time, but I also bought another one that I wanted to act as my primary domain. I dabbled in fanlistings and collectives for a short while, before I realized that much like anything else I'm interested in, I can't commit to something if I'm not hyperfixated on it.</p>

<p>I hit a dry spell after a few years for a bit in not knowing what to do with my love for making websites. I decided to prioritize efficiency by downsizing and making this domain my new main one. It largely resulted from my more concrete knowledge of my ability to maintain interest; though I don't believe I was much different from others, my expectations for myself were too high. In this transitional period, I was unsure what to do about the future because I had no idea what to do with my love for making websites anymore.</p>

<p>But that didn't stop the new ideas from coming and I got them anyway, starting with my prompt generators and my Pok&eacute;mon website &mdash; two massive projects that made me realize that I could do whatever I wanted as long as I thought it was awesome. And now that I was an adult with a job, I could download Photoshop <!-- (and still definitely do pay for it regularly mhm) --> so the quality of my graphics became as good as I had always wanted it to be when I was younger &mdash; to my own ability. I also purchased other domains, for whatever purpose I felt necessary, or just for fun. My hyperfixation on the hobby fluctuates from time to time, but I think there's a reason I keep coming back to it. Especially now that my presence on the independent web feels like a gallery of myself in a way that I feel proud of.</p>

<p>And here I am now. If you've made it this far, thanks for reading!</p>
