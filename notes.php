<h1 id="pa">Privacy & Accessibility</h1>

<p>As a big believer in accessibility and privacy, I have done my best to make my websites as accessible and uninterested in visitor information as possible. This includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Most of my websites working responsively for desktop, tablet, and mobile screen resolutions; or having alternative options (see <a href="#exceptions">exceptions</a>).
<li>Not using tracking cookies for analytics.</li>
<li>No third-party advertisements, sponsorships, corporate endorsements, or pop-ups.</li>
<li>Using semantic HTML as much as possible for screenreaders.</li>
<li>Night-mode option for higher contrast on select sites that contain large blocks of text and where visitor duration may be longer.</li>
<li>Minimal use of flashing animations and GIFs.</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, my websites:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use javascript for same-page navigation, galleries, custom fonts, collapsible lists, and occasional smooth scrolling.</li>
<li>Make simple use of iFrames to convey a small amount of information between separated content.</li>
<li>Do not use any audio on webpages, auto-play or otherwise.</li>
<li>Do not make any use of AI-generated text, images, or content.</li>
<li>Allow little to no access for AI scraping, web crawlers, or search engines. I don't mind being shared or archived but I don't want my data to be commodified either.</li>
</ul>

<p>I regularly link to external websites, and sometimes in a new tab or window. If you click on a link and are unable to see a change in the webpage, be sure to check your browser's tabs or windows to see if the page has opened externally.</p>

<p>Lastly, a good portion of the content on my website is fannish and made for fun and primarily my own enjoyment. Though I recognize that I am responsible for what I put on the internet, I am also a big believer of all visitors having the agency to navigate away from my websites per their own levels of comfort. My websites are accessible, but this does not mean that the content on them is for everyone. Please keep this in mind when perusing.</p>

<h2 id="exceptions">Exceptions</h2>

<p>Due to the way I like to design, a handful of webpages are knowingly not fully accessible, either because they are currently a work in progress, or because of the selective style of the webpage. This includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>My music subsection is built with tables so its responsive appeal is limited due to that. However, its content is still readable and contains a notice when viewing on less than optimal screen sizes.</li>
<li>My manifesto page makes use of an animated background for visual effect without disrupting its readability. It is also compatible with reader view as an alternative.</li>
<li>As I am someone with a strong preference for pastel colors on white, some webpages may have color contrast ratios that are not considered fully accessible. However, most of these pages would not require the visitor to read for longer than a minute or so; the sites that would require visitors to read at length (my fic and projects sections) have a night mode option with a higher contrast ratio.</li>
<li>A number of prompt generators with cosmetic quirks may also have inaccessible color contrasts.</li>
<li>Smaller web projects with varying visual effects may contain their own notes regarding accessibility.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="disclaimers">Disclaimers & Credits</h1>

<p>I am not making any money off of my websites nor do I ever intend to. It's a hobby, not a job for me.</p>

<p>My websites are hand-coded by me as much as possible. Exceptions to this include websites that run on content management systems, which are usually credited on the specific site. Previous CMSes include <a href="https://picocms.org">Pico</a> for one-page websites and <a href="https://gitlab.com/tfl-php-scripts/enthusiast">Enthusiast</a> for fanlistings/collectives. All designs are made by me, with various sources of inspiration.</p>

<p>I commissioned <a href="https://uwibbit.uwu.ai/">Frog</a> for the chibi art and icons of Pat and Pran from Bad Buddy.  </p>

<p>The notebook CSS background pattern used on kingdra.net, /log, and /me is by Sarah Backhouse from the <a href="https://projects.verou.me/css3patterns/#lined-paper">CSS3 Patterns Gallery</a>.</p>

<p>Most stamps, blinkies, pixels, and background images were found by others and compiled uncredited for free use; I claim no artistic ownership of them and only use them decoratively. Pok&eacute;mon trainer sprites are pixel art from <a href="https://play.pokemonshowdown.com/sprites/trainers/">Pok&eacute;mon Showdown</a>. Any other graphics with recognizable characters, people, or visual motifs are either official art/photography of the title in question, and/or created or modified by me in some way for a specific aesthetic purpose. </p>



<p>All other graphics are made by me.</p>

<p>Most fonts on my websites are Google fonts, but have alternatives to achieve similar effects if Google fonts are not enabled. The main fonts I use are:</p>

<ul><li>Rochester/Cookie (they look similar so I use them interchangeably depending on which one looks better) (cursive)</li>
<li>Inconsolata (monospace)</li>
<li>Open Sans (sans-serif)</li>
<li>Futura (sans-serif)</li>
<li>Playfair Display (serif)</li>
<li>Georgia (serif)*</li>
</ul>

<p><small>* not a Google font</small></p>

<p>My prompt generators and other web projects may use other fonts that vary between projects for cosmetic reasons, and are not listed here for my own sanity whenever I make a new one. However, my source code is always freely accessible if you're curious.</p>

<p>Thank you to <a href="https://lysianth.us">Lysianthus</a> for hosting, and <a href="https://cloverso.me">Clover</a>, among others, for being an endless source of inspiration.</p>
