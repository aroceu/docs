<h1 id="workflow">Workflow</h1>

    <p>
        I am not a very disciplined developer. Everything I learned about web development occurred through trial-and-error at the age of 12, raw-dogging the code and my brain along the way. My initial intention in making websites was not to learn, but rather to create something cool at my own situational convenience. I am still like this - I do not use static site generators, WYSIWYG editors, or any other tools to assist with web development beyond writing each line of code that appears on the webpage.
    </p>
    <p>
        But I'm getting ahead of myself, so let's start from the beginning.
    </p>
    <p>
        In initializing a website project, I consider its:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Personal intention, so I can determine which domain it will be housed under.</li>
        <li>Scale, for its initially intended as well as potential future depth. I like making one-page projects because they get finished quicker and are easier to maintain.</li>
        <li>Necessity and frequency of future updates.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Once I've come up with a concept and rattled these deliberations around in my head, I begin to come up with a design. Sometimes my design plans are skeletons or selectively temporary for me to change certain elements later, when I actively see the design on my screen. Other times my plans are more specific and rigid, so I don't get lost in the sauce of decision paralysis. Either way, design plans may live in my head or be sketched out, the latter of which I prefer, since I'm more decisive when I can see it. Well - I'm more decisive when I can make <em>and</em> see it, but that comes next.
    </p>
    <p>
        When I draw out a design, I'll sketch it on anything - a notebook, my tablet, or a piece of cardboard (I have done this before). This particularly goes for larger projects, wherein I can also connect the interactions between pages. I often forgo sketching it if I'm eager enough for a quick turnaround, or if the skeleton is clear enough in my head that I'm happy to make other decisions along the way.
    </p>
    <p>
        It's important to me that my designs are: simple, intuitively navigable, reflect an aspect of myself or the content that I find relevant to indicate on the webpage, and have a unique or fun element that may make it memorable. I'm especially drawn to colors and elemental organization, as well as incorporating functionality into aesthetic appeal. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Some things I keep in mind are:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Font usage. Fonts represent a tone or character, so I consider fonts based on text intention. I generally favor sans-serif and monospace for body text, and use serifs for flavor or to emulate a more bookish or old-school feel.</li>
        <li>Padding and containment, because I'm a big fan of negative space.</li>
        <li>Images. I tend to make more lightweight minimalist designs that don't depend on graphics, so when it comes to image usage I consider their purpose, potential to distract, necessity, quality, and my own abilities.</li>
        <li>Header, navigation, footer, sidebar, and body positioning, or if I decide not to incorporate any of these particular elements.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        In the coding and design process, I work on my projects in Visual Studio Code, with XAMPP as my localhost stack for PHP purposes, and initially test through Firefox and Chrome. I create and edit in raw HTML, CSS, PHP, and JavaScript, though I'll often reference past projects or specific sources of inspiration as coding references. I start with all the base HTML to put the content on the page first, before customizing with CSS and JavaScript, and then dividing into PHP includes when I feel that any fixed code is completed enough. I code modularly and sometimes leave comments in my code, though I've always been a "figure it out" kind of guy, even to myself, so this isn't particularly consistent.
    </p>
    <p>
        Writing CSS is the most fun part for me, so for less text-heavy pages, I spend a lot more time deliberating and perfecting a design until it's precise to my satisfaction. I'm a pendant when it comes to writing in general - word choice, phrasing, and the anatomy of sentences and paragraphs - but I save that for the end, because I'm even <em>more</em> of a perfectionist in copyediting. Either way, though I generally do HTML first and CSS second, I change my mind frequently while writing both, so more often than not it turns into a dual process.
    </p>
    <p>
        It's difficult for me to work on a site without refreshing the page each time I change or add something, no matter how small, just to make sure it looks nice. With everything that I like about making websites, I usually forget things when I start making any project, or get more inspired ideas as I work. I test relative links and user interactions as well when coding and testing locally, and again when the site is online. Often while troubleshooting I get better or newer ideas, so it's not unusual for me to make significant changes at further points in development.
    </p>
    <p>
        For text-heavy projects, when I'm satisfied with the bulk of the code, design, and web-ready implementation, I start copyediting, rewriting, and rewording rigorously. I continue to do this after a site is live; I frequently have my phone or computer speak out loud longer blocks of text so I can hear how they sound. (I never do this with my fiction writing.) I also write alt text in this stage, if I remember to.
    </p>
    <p>
        When I feel that a site is ready to go live, or if I've made all the changes that I want to make in the sitting, I commit the project or changes to GitHub via GitHub Desktop, and pull through GitVersion control in cPanel. Some projects or pages do not use Git due to how its umbrella domain is set up; <code>aroceu.com</code> and <code>kingdra.net</code> in particular house multiple Git projects, so root projects don't use Git. In this case, I upload files with FTP via Forklift. I try not to make more tiny changes after this, as using XAMPP has reduced that bad habit of mine. But no promises.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once a project is online, I do endless troubleshooting. I love visiting my own websites, imposing my high standards on myself, and, as time passes, evolving my perspective to tweak, change, and add things. Much like fashion, I believe that a website's development is never over, and I like discovering ways I can improve, expand, or make more of them. So eventually, my workflow stays in this troubleshooting stasis period forever. Or starts all over again.

        <blockquote><p>This is personal and subjective account of my journey through website-making, my relationship 
            with the internet, and my evolution of comprehension, in websites and especially about myself.</p>

            My first real website was on Geocities when I was 11-years old, shortly after my new best friend had 
            convinced me to secretly make an email, against my mother's will. My friend had a Yahoo account, so I had 
            one too. As soon as she discovered Geocities was a thing, she told me immediately. We ventured into
            making websites together.
        </p>
        <p>
            Of course, since it was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoCities">Geocities</a> and I was 11, I had a drag-and-drop 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG">what-you-see-is-what-you-get</a> editor, and no
            aesthetic sense at all. I liked things more than looks at the time, and I was obsessed with cheese. So I made my 
            first website sort of look like cheese with yellow text, and a black background because I kept reading in the dark.
            And I wanted to be edgy.
        </p>
        <p>
            My first website was a silly newsletter that my best friend helped me write. We made a paper zine version of it as
            well. My friend was the one who scoured the internet more than me at the time, constantly telling me to make an account 
            on each new site she discovered. She got me into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMVU"></a>IMVU, which also had 
            a drag-and-drop website editor, so I was happily fixated with it for much longer. She moved onto GaiaOnline and other 
            websites, venturing into code as I spent most of my time looking for new graphics to add to my IMVU profile page.
        </p>
        <p>
            When we moved to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myspace">MySpace</a>, I discovered that it was just as 
            customizable, but only with code, not with a drag-and-drop editor anymore. I didn't even know what HTML did, despite 
            that I added hundreds of copy-and-paste codes for icons on my IMVU page. My friend taught me enough so that 
            I could make my profile look the way I wanted it to - black and white with a ton of icons again - while she went with 
            more deliberately pieced aesthetics, like pinks and browns, pinks and greys, pinks and whites, and pinks and greens.
        </p>
        <p>
            I technically discovered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quizilla">Quizilla</a> on my own - and from there, fanfiction - 
            but really dove into it when another friend randomly sent me a chain letter reposted to the site. It didn't take me long to 
            discover that Quizilla profiles had a personal webpage element to them too. Not only that, but these Photoshop-, HTML-, and CSS-based 
            webpages looked completely different from any other personal profile I had seen before. I was curious, enamored, 
            and started learning by doing.
        </p>
        <p>
            Well, by changing people's code to my own tastes. I wasn't interested in learning how to write code, I just wanted an
            end result that <em>looked</em> like it was completely my own. But I didn't read up on any tutorials because I didn't 
            have the attention span, so with my limited knowledge, I barely knew what I was doing, like playing a video game for the first time
            without reading. I stumbled through the dark for that first persistent but experimental month, in
            January 2008. By February 2008, I had modified enough code that I was comfortable making my first website with it.
        </p>

        <p>
            And so came my first site, hosted on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freewebs">Freewebs</a>, which was a free subdomain host that 
            popped up in a lot of Quizilla layout credits. My first website title had my IRL name in it, and its first 
            main graphic was frankensteined in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSPaint">MSPaint</a>. There's a 100% chance that the first code I used was stolen. 
            But it was mine. What it looked like and what I put on it was entirely my decision, and that part was immediately thrilling.
        </p>

        <p>
            Since the first types of personal websites I had encountered created and shared layouts for others, that was what my first website became. 
            I made layouts frequently, still through this method of not-exactly-writing-my-own-code. I made these layouts a bit <em>too</em>
            frequently, actually; but as I did, my understanding of HTML and CSS began to more fluently develop. Though I often
            felt insecure about my graphic design ability, my confidence in understanding code grew. And it helped that I was so addicted: 
            I enjoyed webdesigning so much that I kept wanting to do it. It felt impossible for me to stop.
        </p>

        <p>
            And I've always been a bit brazen on the internet. Once I noticed other people's Freewebs sites had affiliates, which
            sometimes just meant you asked to affiliate in their chatbox, I thought to myself, well, I could do that too. So I did:
            I asked to affiliate with sites I liked, and that eventually turned into an excuse for me to browse personal websites. 
            Sometimes my applications to affiliate got rejected, but I wasn't really bothered, because I just wanted to find more websites to visit.  
        </p>

        <p>
            Still, one rejection was memorable: I was told that my prolificness was admirable, but my graphic quality was lacking.
            And it was true - I was still using Paint. I wished I had Photoshop like all the cool kids, but I was young and traditionally didn't ask my parents to buy me software. 
            So instead, I searched the internet for similar freeware, and found <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serif_PhotoPlus">PhotoPlus</a>, the imitation program I liked the most.
        </p>

        <p>
            It wasn't PhotoShop, but it wasn't Paint. There was certainly more I could do, at least. My initial attempts were rough,
            but as I tried and errored, I eventually got better. To the point of effectiveness, at least, because there are graphic
            designers I will always admire. But with PhotoPlus now in my life, after changing my website layout monthly four months in
            a row, on the fifth I created my favorite at the time - a three column top navigation iframe layout, launched right as the
            summer was ending and I was about to start my first day of high school.
        </p>

        <p>
            This layout lasted a whopping three months before I changed it again, this time to a temporary Christmas theme (launched in October) 
            as I worked on an official sixth version. However, due to emotional circumstances that had everything to do with aforementioned 
            middle school best friend who got me online, my interest waned for several weeks before I turned to the internet as a crutch, now socially lost.
        </p>

        <p>
            Still, I understood more now and felt in need of a rebrand, particularly because I wanted to do something fun with my next website 
            name. I knew I was better, too, both as a graphic designer and a coder. And at the time there was a hierarchy of website 
            sophistication in my head: from Quizilla, to Freewebs, to a subdomain, and then a domain. I knew I would want a 
            domain eventually, but I was happy to take my time to invest and improve even further, especially as a distraction.
        </p>

        <p>
            My second website and first subdomain was acquired in February 2009, and the layout I made for it was the first code I had written
            entirely from scratch. I was more confident than ever now in understanding what code <em>meant</em>, not just what it did. 
            I even started to delve into PHP, though I was still too scared to touch JavaScript. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The more I explored in the personal web outside of Freewebs, the more I discovered outside of sozai/layout sites. 
            I quickly found bloggers, fascinated at the concept of people writing extensively about their lives, something which, 
            understandably at the time, felt too personal and tumultuous for me. But I also love thinking and spinning narratives 
            out of everything, so I entertained it for a bit, trying to find my voice and what I wanted to talk about, instead of my 
            latently developing personality disorders.
        </p>

        <p>
            Despite this, I continued on with my layout-making hyperfixation, so passionately that five months later, I asked my mom
            for a domain for my birthday. It was only $12/year - I didn't realize domains were that cheap - so she agreed, and I got it. The domain was on a whim and wasn't something I felt personally connected to, and
            with my mom knowing it I now felt monitored in this hobby and on my blog. But it was fulfilling nonetheless, 
            and motivated me to keep at it, to learn, and to be more confident, for me.
        </p>

        <p>
            My growing attempts to improve came to an abrupt halt when a k-pop hyperfixation took over my life at the end of 2009.
        </p>

        <p>
            I then wrote over half a million words annually for the next two years, but don't worry about that. When my domain expired in
            July 2010, I decided to let it go because the k-pop brainworms were too strong, and the last layout for the site - the second overall -
            was dedicated to my ex, after we had given up on our relationship in January of that year. I created a small home for the
            things I had been sharing since my first site in the meantime, on a new Freewebs subdomain.
        </p>

        <p>
            As my hyperfixations rotated several times and waned, I treaded back to the hobby in bursts, a year or so older 
            and with a new pair of eyes. That foray into k-pop was a much needed break; as I made new layouts for my 
            own amusement, it didn't take long for me to notice how much my aesthetic sense had improved. But despite those short bursts 
            of layout-making addiction, fanfiction-writing still had a much stronger grip on me. Regardless, realizing I had 
            gotten better simply over time had me thinking that I could probably be skilled at this too, like I wanted to be with writing.
        </p>

        <p>
            This is the primary reason for my initial deliberation between Computer Science and Creative Writing, when it came to what 
            I would eventually major in college. As an adult some decades later, though, I'll tell you now that I majored in both and don't have a degree in either.</p>

        <p>But with this on my mind, in my sophomore year I opted to make a website for an English high school project, instead of something related to writing.
            The website was not very good - and, weirdly, was the first time I tried using both WordPress and XAMPP.
            Afterward I realized how little I cared, though, and how much more I wanted to polish my fiction-writing skills from a peer-reviewed perspective.
            I only felt interested in making websites for myself, so I easily decided to major in Creative Writing by junior year,
            before even applying for colleges.
        </p>

        <p>
            At the end of 2011, in an attempt to help wane my writing addiction (which was getting a little out of hand), 
            I rekindled my interest in making websites and improving through the process. I returned to the subdomain world 
            with my first (real) attempt at a WordPress theme, a three-column top navigation site. But this time I wasn't interested 
            in making layouts for other people. Well, that wasn't my intention, anyway. I wanted to get into blogging, 
            because I knew at this point that I couldn't commit to making layouts and content if I wasn't hyperfixated.
        </p>

        <p>
            I continued to struggle finding my voice in blogging, but as usual, I got the webdesign itch after that first WordPress theme.
            I made a second version a month later, then a third a month after that, and then I was staring at my 
            text editor and thinking, <em>What if I made a series of WordPress themes based on the colors of the rainbow?</em> It was just to make
            different types of WordPress themes with different aesthetic identities - I didn't expect anyone to actually use them. But 
            it would be fun. And I would get even more familiar with WordPress in the meantime.
        </p>

        <p>
            So I did, and developed a new theme for my own site monthly for the rest of the year as well, as I graduated
            high school and started my first year of college. I soon got a job at the library and with my own money, I finally bought Photoshop, after four years of pining
            for it. My mental health took a nosedive the following year, but I wanted a domain again. I had one 
            in mind this time, one that felt personal and <em>me</em>, and had a sparkly fun <code>.nu</code> TLD. Since
            I had my own money now, I bought it for myself.
        </p>

        <p>
            However, the combination of my poor mental health and my internal need to maintain my blog soon made my website an 
            uncomfortable mental health diary. I had split the project apart into several different
            sections with no consistent identity, which made my internal fragmentation even worse. Despite this, somehow, I started
            and finished another series of WordPress themes, this time based on the months of the year. I'm still proud of 
            the themes I made during this difficult period of my life; designing them really helped me figure out what aesthetics I felt 
            drawn to.
        </p>

        <p>
            As the memories and association with my old blog (and username) soured over a short yet too long year, I ditched it eighteen
            months later and created a new username in December of 2014: aroceu. I bought <strong>aroceu.com</strong> almost immediately after 
            establishing it, on my half birthday of a new decade, eager to not wallow in my self-hatred anymore. However, for a long time I had always thought of
            <code>.nu</code> domains as the peak of sophistication when it comes to TLDs, so I bought another one, which was not named "aroceu"
            because it would've sounded bad with the TLD. I tried blogging again but didn't really get into it, and dabbled in fanlistings
            a few times before I quickly realized how tedious they were for me to maintain. 
        </p>

        <p>
            I desperately wanted to channel my interest in making websites into <em>something</em>, though. My mental health fluctuated and
            I dropped out of college. I wrote more fanfiction, and got really obsessed with a movie about the making of an ontologically evil 
            social media site. I traveled for six months. I went to therapy. I was asked, "Do you think you might have ADHD?" for the first time, 
            at the age of 22.
        </p>

        <p>
            After a long dry and depressive spell, my brain started whirring with ideas again. A simple text-based list didn't accurately depict how widespread
            and categorical my fannish interests are. When I absently thought, <em>well, I could make a website that does</em>, I had no reason 
            not to and I had all the time in the world. So I did, getting my fingers into JavaScript for the first time.</p> 
            
            <p>Then I remembered how years ago, in 2010, I'd found a pairing and prompt generator for my first
            and forever k-pop boy group, Super Junior. I thought, <em>I could make something similar for my current hyperfixation</em> because it had an even 
            bigger cast of guys, Haikyuu. So I made a Haikyuu prompt generator.</p> 
            
            <p>Then I made generic ones as an alternative option for only prompts; one for my ontologically questionable movie obsession; and a few more as suggestions from friends, 
                happy to channel my love for this hobby into projects which could be used by others in a fannish way. I was only interested in making generators for fandoms I was in or 
                specifically as suggested by a friend, so I was curious about what fandoms I'd get into in the future, what friends I'd make, and what prompt generators might result.
        </p>

        <p>
            I tried getting into fanlistings (and, for a moment, shrines) again, but what I was having the most fun with, like usual, was constructing the site. I didn't really care to get my
            fanlistings approved, nor, still, did I have any interest in maintaining them. Despite this, my love for Pok&eacute;mon constantly weighed 
            on my mind during my venture back in, because I wanted to make a site inspired by my love for Pok&eacute;mon, 
            but not something that felt impersonal or meant for others. I wanted to make a Pok&eacute;mon design and website that was really only meant to 
            be for me, but not a fanlisting.

            And so Masterball was born, named just so and as <em>pkmn</em> under my <code>.nu</code> domain at the time. Suddenly this felt like a bigger project, 
            because I always played new Pok&eacute;mon games, and I'd loved Pok&eacute;mon longer than I've loved writing or the internet. There was a
            very slim chance Pok&eacute;mon - or this site - would ever become irrelevant to me. And even if it did, its main purpose was to be an archive - a catalogue
            of my history with the franchise, so the emotional attachment to my Pok&eacute;mon didn't feel trapped in bytes and memories in my game cartridges. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Masterball made me realize that I didn't have to make websites like everyone else. I could make whatever websites I wanted, so as long 
            as I felt passionate about their existence. Even starting a project that would never come into fruition was more valuable than 
            not doing so at all. This occurred a couple of times, one of which made me realize the organization of WordPress as a content 
            management system would make it quite useful for me to archive my writing.

            But I had a lot of fic. And as my life continued aimlessly, I had long become tired of myself. In fandom, on the internet, and as a writer.
            Not to mention my mental health was worsening again. </p>
        
        <p>I moved out of my childhood home with the excuse of going back to college, seeking an environment where I didn't feel so constantly triggered
            that my relationship with the internet was suffering as well. I took a clean break from being so online in September 2017, and 
            retired my <em>.nu</em> domain in 2018, since I no longer felt attached to it.
        </p>

        <p>
            During my hiatus, I occasionally popped online to make a prompt generator, add a couple of pages as I played new Pok&eacute;mon games, and move Masterball to its own domain. 
            But ultimately I had realized how terminally online I had become, and my new roommates were in a similar boat, so this was a much-needed break. From 
            the internet, and from who I used to be. Things that I was scared of, ashamed of, and didn't want to admit about myself. This 
            worked wonders on my mental health, though I wasn't <em>technically</em> offline. (I read a lot of fanfiction and got really into 
            Splatoon and Pok&eacute;mon Shiny Den hunting through Discord.) But wanting to heal and being in a space where I could heal - well, I did heal.
        </p>

        <p>
            I returned to fandom and writing fanfiction in July 2020, but this isn't about that. This also isn't about my moving and the resulting materially difficult 2021
            I had (though I did make my iconic Sexy Times with Wangxian tag generator in the meantime). Nor is it about the social bullshit I endured both then and in 2022, 
            and the proceeding trauma from it in 2023, which would have broken me had I not taken that three-year long hiatus for clarity earlier.
        </p>

        <p>
            Instead, this story starts again in 2024. I had made my hyper-ambitious fic site the previous May and was proud of it, 
            but it was the only website I really worked on in 2023. Since I had made the dominant color on my fic site light blue, 
            I felt that it was only fitting to change the accent color on my main site to light blue as well, from the bright pink it had been for the past nine years.
            I changed the color in January 2024, and expanded and reworked my main index page beyond being a more interesting <a href="https://fanlore.org/wiki/Carrd">Carrd</a>. And for the first half of the 
            year I dawdled around my site, adding small but less designed sections, adjusting things when brief inspiration struck. 
        </p>

        <p>
            In September I randomly decided to browse <a href="https://cloverso.me">Clover's</a> Neocities site. The benefit of having 
            a fannish webdesign friend since 2012 is if I want inspiration that will most likely appeal to me, I can just visit 
            their site. I'd heard of Neocities for years now but hadn't been interested in using it, since I long had my own domain, and 
            just looked around for fun.
        </p>

        <p>
            But when I visited, their <a href="https://catso.neocities.org/library/">library</a> certainly was an inspiration. To say the least.</p>

            <p>My list of fandoms had been retired for a few years now and I didn't really feel motivated to make another one, but
                this page changed my mind. A short few days later, I had made a fannish media library in the same way.
            Clover had also made their own version of a fic site after seeing mine, which I was thrilled by. Making my library got me 
            thinking about personal sites again - especially considering the state of the corporate web in 2024 - so I wrote a manifesto,
            updated my existing websites, created a links section, gave kingdra.net its first design after nine years,
            and the rest is history.
        </p>

        <p>
            Well, it's mostly to say that since then, I haven't really stopped, as of the time of writing this. With a deeper 
            understanding and a lot more confidence, from my perspectives to how I present myself, I've been getting a constant stream of 
            website ideas, whether as a personal archive, for others, as a testament to my younger self, or just straight up inspired by 
            a page on someone else's hobbyist website. In October 2024, I transitioned to Git and improved my workflow to be far more efficient 
            than before. In November I reworked and finally made Masterball responsive; in December I made my first webring; in February I established an 'about' section;
            in March I started developing a web-interface game (still in-progress...), and in April 2025 I coded and developed the entirety of <a href="https://berelyse.org/">Berelyse</a>,
            the first code I've ever fully written with the intention of being used by and to appeal to someone other than me. I desperately 
            wanted to make a page about my dog that I could show people in real life, but I didn't want to link it to any of my internet 
            pseudonyms. So in May 2025 I launched <strong>three-apples.org</strong> as another website project for my more offline self.
        </p>

        <p>
            Ultimately, I like writing fiction because it's fun, I want to be good at it, and I like getting my writing peer-reviewed so I know I am. 
            But I don't really care about being "good" when it comes to making websites - I just want to like the things I make, in the way I want to make them. I equally love seeing other people do the same,
            especially considering the state of our current internet landscape. This is why I made <a href="https://kingdra.net/fan/">Magpies</a>
            in July 2025. 
        </p>

        <p>
            But more importantly, it's to say that growth is neverending, and so is the evolution of me and my websites. Though my hyperfixations
            may fluctuate, my desire to find the fullest, truest version of myself will never cease. I think there's a reason I keep coming back to this hobby; these days
            I feel happier with my sites, the way I present myself, and, well, myself. My presence on the independent web has become
            a gallery of who I want to be, who I am, and I'm excited to discover what the future may hold.
