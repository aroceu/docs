# docs

Documentation for all of my websites.

This was originally on one page, before I realized it was getting too long and split everything up categorically. I talk about things I think visitors might be interested in reading as well as things about my websites and development process I want to share for the hell of it in equal part here.

I've written additional documentation for my fic site and my gifts site, which are linked here.

Github repositories amd my Github pages are shared here as well.

### features

- A similar layout to my manifesto page, on purpose
- ID jumping navigation
- Vagueness and specificity in equal part
