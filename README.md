# docs

Documentation for all of my websites.

This was originally on one page, before I realized it was getting too long and split everything up categorically. I talk about things I think visitors might be interested in reading as well as things about my websites and development process I want to share for the hell of it in equal part here.

I've written additional documentation for my fic site and my gifts site, which are linked here.

Github repositories amd my Github pages are shared here as well.

### features

- A similar layout to my manifesto page, on purpose
- ID jumping navigation
- Vagueness and specificity in equal part

## text archives

### for icirr.us
Moved 9 December 2024.

<p>Also known as &quot;Masterball,&quot; this is my Pok&eacute;mon website where I showcase everything relevant to my love for Pok&eacute;mon. This site is separated into two major parts, &quot;Trainer&quot; (parties of my main game playthroughs), and &quot;Gym&quot; (Pok&eacute;mon Go and website-related stuff). More will be added for Pok&eacute;Rogue/fangames and TCG.</p>
<p>The front page is designed like a masterball in a clean pastel style, which translates across the trainer pages, the map, and the landing navigation page. The gym pages, meanwhile, are a little more old school.</p>
<h2>trainer</h2>
<p>An archive of the mainline games I&#39;ve played, and my teams on the games. On the landing page, there is a link to an &quot;About&quot; section along with an icon of the type of NPC I would be in game, a Ranger (female, ORAS). This page also links to a biographical section about my relationship with Pok&eacute;mon, as well as my favorites. </p>
<p>Each game page is color themed by its game, e.g. Ruby is red, HeartGold is a light yellow, and so on. As the platform for each changes, some stylistic elements of the page may be added to reflect this: games on the 3DS have a &quot;3D&quot; effect, while Switch games have borders on both sides. My trainer selection of choice (usually female) is on the page, along with the region, year I played it, and a small blurb about my relationship with the game. At the bottom is a footer navigating between all the games in the &quot;trainer&quot; section.</p>
<p>Each party Pok&eacute;mon has listed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Its species (Pok&eacute;mon)</li>
<li>Gender</li>
<li>Pok&eacute;ball caught in </li>
<li>Name</li>
<li>Current level</li>
<li>Nature/characteristic</li>
<li>Ribbons (if applicable)</li>
<li>IVs</li>
<li>Ability</li>
<li>Moveset (Javascript dropdown box)</li>
</ul>
<p>Pages in this section in addition to the games include: </p>
<ul>
<li>Favorites (of everything I could possibly have a favorite of)</li>
<li>Shiny gallery</li>
<li>Misc - other teams I have used for other playthroughs (which were not my first, or because the Pok&eacute;mon meant something to me in some way) or goals</li>
</ul>
<h2>gym</h2>
<p>The landing page is designed to be reminiscent of a gym from the first gen I ever owned/played, Pok&eacute;mon Ruby/gen 3. The navigation is reminiscent of the standard battle menu.</p>
<h4>fight</h4>
<p>The &quot;about the site&quot; section. Contains animated pixels of 5 Pok&eacute;mon who are internal links (via Javascript dropdown); they are also all steel types. </p>

<li>Masterball x1 (takes you back to index)</li>

<h4>Pok&eacute;mon Go</h4>

<li>Trainer code</li>
