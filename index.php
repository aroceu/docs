<h1>Documentation</h1>
<h3>Last updated: July 27, 2025</h3>

<p>Extensive metadata on all of my websites, my design and coding process, my introspective reflections, and other technical miscellany.</p>

<h1 id="about">About the Site</h1>

<p>Or sites, as it were, and myself.</p>

<p>My websites are a continuous personal journey for me to <mark>have fun</mark>,  to <u>make things I think are cool</u>, and to express myself through a series of both logistical and personal decisions, as art tends to do. My primary domain, <strong>aroceu.com</strong>, is the full embodiment of this. Of me, in website form, though all of my other websites are an extension of myself in other ways too. I've always loved computers and the internet before I knew what they were capable of. Over the years, I've learned how to cultivate a digital presence that is uniquely mine.</p>

<p>In that time, my fannish and creative nature took centerfold, so much so that nearly every website I have now is based on my love for something in some way. Despite this, I'm primarily invested in websites for myself - I'm my biggest critic, but also my biggest fan. When it comes to websites, I make designs I love, catalogue things that shaped me into who I am, and learn as I grow at my own pace, both in logistics and as a human person. Ever since I was eleven-years old with a Geocities WYSIWYG editor in front of me, I've only ever sought to answer two things with my websites: <em>who am I?</em>, and <em>how do I want the world to see me?</em></p>

<p>Like everyone else, I'm going through my own journey. I've missed a handful of indie web movements, and I know more about (and own more) websites than the average fan, but I'm a lot more fannish than the average webmaster. I'm a writer but I don't like blogging, and my favorite thing about art is the absolute constraints of code, not the freedom of a canvas. But I like myself as much as I like unraveling myself, as unconventional (or conventional) I may be. My websites are what it looks like when some of the spools of my personality have been untangled and woven into a semi-permanent tapestry on the internet.</p>

<p>It's a continuous process as well, but that's the beauty of it. In the same way that I change as I work on myself, so do my websites. They are both an archive of who I've been and a reflection of who I am today, presented through a purely self-taught skill just so I can like myself a bit better. And as the main evaluator of that standard, I think I've done pretty well so far.</p>

<h1 id="content-warnings">Content Warnings</h1>

<ul>
	<li>I am an adult and I make my websites for myself. In other words, I primarily craft my websites for an adult audience.</li>
	<li>Though this does not necessarily mean that my websites are categorically "adult", <strong>I do engage with fictional NSFW content</strong> and it may appear on my websites (usually in text-form), particularly when it comes to my fanfiction, prompt generators, and gifts.</li>
	<li>Warnings are in place when applicable. Not safe-for-work content will not be browsable without prior warnings.</li>
	<li>I am weird and perverted about fictional characters, and I regard some celebrities and public figures (i.e. real people) similarly, because it is fun for me. Being into RPF is an inextricable part of who I am, but I understand if people don't like it. I make a concentrated effort not to make my RPF-tendencies a problem for the real people in question. I would appreciate being treated similarly.</li>
	<li>Oh, and there's a lot of gay stuff around. But if this is a warning for you, then you probably don't want to be here.</li>
</ul>
